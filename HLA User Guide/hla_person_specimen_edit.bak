<li>There are two ways to get to the Edit Person/Specimen window:
  <ul>
  <li>Select DataEntry|EditPersonSpecimen from the menu bar
  <li>From the Result Entry detail window, click the [Edit Person/Specimen] button</p>
  </ul>
<li>The compter opens the Edit Person/Specimen data entry window. You can change any of the values except Ref# or Specimen number.  You can also remove a value unless it is a required value. To remove a dictionary value, select the item -not entered-</p>
<li>Delete Specimen. You can delete a specimen by selecting the checkbox 'Flag as Deleted'.  The system prompts you to confirm. When you click the SAVE button, the specimen is deleted. Notes on deletion: 
  <ul>
  <li>The specimen is not physically removed: it has its deletion flag set (so it cannot be selected) and it has the comment '*** DELETED ***' added.
  <li>When deleted, this specimen is removed from these batches: NMDP Open Batch, Report Queue, Recent list.
  <li>Deleting a specimen does not change the HLA type, which is a person-level value. However, the specimen will not be included on NMDP or Cord exports.
  </ul>

	<LI>To open the Result Entry List window, select Result Entry from the Data
	Entry menu. The computer opens the Result Entry List window, and
	displays any newly added rows you did not result in your last
	session. 
	</P>
	<LI>Sections of this window. At the top of the window is the [Select] button
	which you use to select specimens for the list, and checkboxes where
	you choose selection options. The main, middle part of the window
	displays the specimens in the list. Below this list, on the left, is
	a list of Select Option actions, with a [GO] button to run the
	selected action. Other buttons on the bottom of the window are
	[Remove Row] and [Save and Close]. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>To close the list, you must first print the Verification Log if any rows in the list have the
	status <B>Resulted</B>. Then click the [Save and Close] button. You
	can also click the window close button; when you do this, the system
	prompts you to save changes. <B>Note: The changes you are saving
	here are the changes to the result list. The actual test results
	were already saved, when you clicked the [Save] button in the Result
	Entry Detail window.</B>

<H3><A NAME="re_select"></A>Selecting specimens for the list</H3>
<OL>
	<LI><P>There are three selection modes: single, sequential, or batch entry.</P> 
	<UL>

	</UL></P>
	<LI>After Single or Sequential select, the system adds the specimen to the
	result list, with status New.

<H3><A NAME="re_detail"></A>Result
Entry Detail Window</H3>
<OL>
	<LI>The computer opens the Result Entry Detail window from the Result Entry
	List. You use the detail window to file actual test results for a
	single specimen.</P>
	<LI>The detail window has three display areas:</P>
	<UL>
		<LI>Banner:
		Display-only area at the top with Patient/donor and specimen
		information, and HLA-type on file
		<LI>Test

	</UL>
	<LI>Selecting
	a test to result. In the test list area, click the checkbox next to
	the test you want to result. The computer selects this row,
	highlighting it in blue, and it displays any previous data in the
	data entry area. For an HLA-type test, the computer displays the
	HLA-type fields, and the comment field. For other test types, the
	computer displays the result text field and the comment field.</P>
	<LI>Selecting a test to view its detail. In the test list area, click somewhere in

<OL>
	<LI>Entering an HLA-type result</P>
	<UL>
		<LI>Click
		the checkbox next to the HLA test you want to result. The computer
		looks for new preliminary results and adds them to the type (but
		note rules for this below). It also displays a list of the new
		results added. Then the computer moves you to the HLA type data
		entry field.
		<LI>To
		modify any of the HLA allele values, click the [Edit] button or
		press Enter (this button is the default button when you are in the
		HLA field) and change the value, then click the [Edit OK] button.

		<LI>Type the text in directly
		<LI>Type a period character followed by the abbreviation of a canned
		comment. The computer translates the abbreviations into their

		canned comment must be either at the start of the text, or it must
		follow a space character.
		<LI>Click the <U>more</U> link to open the Text entry window. This window has

	checkbox. Then click the <U>Delete this test</U> link.
	The system prompts you to confirm, then it flags the test as
	deleted: it displays the test name with a strike-through character,

The Cord Export window allows you to export a file of cord HLA types to a cord donor site.  It is an exact replacement of the HLA Mumps function.</p>

<h3>Additions</h3>
Version 1-20: Export now includes SERO equivalents for antigens

<h3>Procedure</h3>
<ol>
<li>When the window opens, select a cord donor site from the drop-down list, and select a typing method. <B>Note: Worcester cords are under the donor site DEDHAM</b></li>
<li>Click the 'Retrieve Cord List' button to see the list of cords on the computer screen.  Default sort order is by last-name, this was the way cord ids were entered in the HLA system. You can click on any column to sort by that column.</li>
<li>Click the 'Export' button to create the export file. The system creates a comma-delimited text file with these fields: ID, ALLLELDT, HLADT, ACTION, A1, A2, B1, B2, DA1, DA2, DB1, DB2, RB11, RB12, RB31, RB32, RB41, RB42, RB51, RB52, METHOD, HLA_REF.  The A1,A2,B1,B2 are the serologic equivalent values of the A/B antigens. The value HLA_REF is the identifiers assigned to the sample by the HLA lab.</li>
<li>ZIP this file and email it to the data manager of the cord site.</li>
</ol>

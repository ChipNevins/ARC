The HLA Reader, also known as the HLA Bridge, is a function in the HLA Oracle system which reads data exported from the HLA Mumps, Quicktype, RELI and Luminex. The programs which handle these parts are referred to below as the Mumps reader, the RELI reader, the Quicktype reader and the Liminex reader. To run the reader, select Tools|Reader from the main menu. The system takes a few seconds to gather the list of files to read.  When the list is displayed, click the Run button.

<li>Specimen login is still done in the Mumps system. After each new specimen is filed, the Mumps program writes the patient/donor, specimen and test-order values to a datafile in folder r:\hla\xml\. The Oracle HLA Reader then reads these values into Oracle.
<li>Dictionaries.  New dictionary values come over the bridge when the value is used in a patient/donor/test record.
<li>Technical note: Oracle uses the primary key values assigned in Mumps.
<li>The historical data comes over the same bridge, but this can be run only by the programmer. As of 13-Nov-03, we have converted data for specimens going back to September 1997.
<li>The XML Writer is the 'Mumps' part of the Mumps-to-Oracle bridge.  It writes new records and updated records to XML-format files. Normally, the XML writer runs automatically. It starts every day at 7:30am and stops at 11pm.  The XML writer runs in the background, creating XML data files in the directory <TT><font size=2>r:\hla\xml\</font></TT>.
<li>If you need to start or stop the writer manually, follow this procedure:
  <OL>
  <LI>Log into the Mumps HLA system. Select option XML Writer under the HLA Bridge menu.</LI>
  <LI>The system will tell you that the writer is running or not running, and allows you to start or stop the writer. Note that, after you issue the stop request, the writer will take up to 30 seconds to actually stop.</LI>
  </OL>
<li>If the Mumps writer stops, check the last XML file in <tt>r:\hla\xml</tt>: if it is incomplete (missing the ending XML tag), delete it.  Then remove the first item in the Mumps queue: <tt>^hlaxml("Q",</tt> and restart the writer
<li>If the Oracle reader stops with an error, remove the <u>first</u> XML file (the one it was trying to read), then restart the reader.
</ol>

<H3><A NAME="hb_reli">RELI Reader</H3>
<ol>
<li>From the RELI application, users export test readings to folder r:\ReliRm\. These are preliminary readings.
<li>The RELI Reader reads the RELI values into the HLA Readings table. You can see these readings in Person/Donor Inquiry, and they a pulled in as default HLA antigen values in Result Entry.
<li>The RELI reader needs to parse this file to read it, and the file must meet these conditions.
  <ul>
  <li>The file must be tab-delimited, with at least 12 columns
  <li>The R# must be in column 5, and the reading values in column 4
  <li>The reader removes the 'HLA-' prefix from the locus.  Once removed, the locus value must be in the list A,B,CW,DRB1
  </ul>
<li>Once a file is read, it is not read again unless it the file is updated and gets a new timestamp.
</ol>

<H3><A NAME="hb_lifc">Quicktype Reader</H3>
<ol>
<li>Quicktype values are read directly from the Quicktype database by the Oracle Result Entry function.  In other words, this reader runs within Result Entry, for one specimen, when that specimen is called up in Result Entry.
<li>The reader files Quicktype values in the HLA Readings table
</ol>

<H3><A NAME="hb_luminex">Luminex Reader</H3>
<ol>
<li>The Luminex reader is new in HLA Oracle version 1.35
<li>From the OneLambda application, users create LBSW files in the folder r:\Luminex-LBSW\Clinical Results\. These are <b>non-standard</b> LBSW files because the Ref#, not the NMDP Id, is put in some of the records.
<li>IMPORTANT NOTE: The file must have the R-number in the format Rnnnnnn. You must enter the leading zero, and you cannot enter the dash-two, dash-3, etc.
<li>The Luminex reader parses the LBSW file, and puts the data values into the HLA Readings table
<li>One a file is read, it is not read again unless it the file is updated and gets a new timestamp.
</ol>

<H3><A NAME="hb_logfile">Checking the LOG file</H3>
<li>When the HLA bridge reads data into Oracle - from Mumps, RELI or Luminex - it keeps a log of the data read. There is one logfile for each day, stored in the folder r:\hla\log.
<li>If you think a newly logged-in specimen or a preliminary typing did not come over the bridge, you can search the logfile for this date. After you check the file, please close it - <b>DO NOT leave this logfile open</b>.

<H3><A NAME="hb_xml">Note on XML</H3>
The data exported from HLA Mumps to Oracle is in XML format. XML is a mark-up language which can be used to format data which is being sent between computer systems.  XML is replacing older fixed-column or delimited formats in some industries.  XML is similar to HTML - in fact, its name means 'E<u>X</u>tended HTML'.  One good thing about XML is that you can view it in your browser.You can view these XML files: open Windows Explorer, go to the folder which contains the file you just created. Double-click the filename you want to view.  Explorer will open this file in your web browser. Note that these files are deleted after they are read by the MUMPS Reader</A>

<P>
Below is an example of a simple XML file that contains a donor record. The file holds one data item per line, and each data item is preceeded and followed by the data item name. <b>A file must start and end with the XML tag - otherwise it is incomplete.</b>

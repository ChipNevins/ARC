LABType Visual How-to View Files.txt


I have installed LABType Visual 2.0 on the computer named HLAXP3 (next to georgia's cubicle), and put the historical MDB data on that machine.  I also put a copy of these files on the T: drive  (\\hla4\ltv) .

Why we need LTVdbGlobal.mdb as well as LTVdbRecords_2p0...
- it has the catalog list; without it the sample detail is not dislayed
- it stores the current DB an operator (user) is using. Without this the ability to switch db's does not work

Warning:  I used the LTVGlobal.mdb file from Sharon's old PC.  I am not sure if this MDB has all catalogs, and I do not know how to load a catalog into this MDB.  You may need to follow up on this part.

The files on HLAXP3:
Data files:
  C:\LABTypeVisual_2p0\LumAnalysisNet\LTVdbRecords\LTVdbRecords_2p0_01.mdb
  C:\LABTypeVisual_2p0\LumAnalysisNet\LTVdbRecords\LTVdbRecords_2p0_02.mdb
  C:\LABTypeVisual_2p0\LumAnalysisNet\LTVdbRecords\LTVdbRecords_2p0_03.mdb
  C:\LABTypeVisual_2p0\LumAnalysisNet\LTVdbRecords\LTVdbRecords_2p0_04.mdb
Global file:
    C:\LABTypeVisual_2p0\LumAnalysisNet\bin\LTVdbGlobal_2p0.mdb

The files on T: drive   (\\hla4\ltv\)
Data files:
  T:\LTVdbRecords\LTVdbRecords_2p0_01.mdb
  T:\LTVdbRecords\LTVdbRecords_2p0_02.mdb
  T:\LTVdbRecords\LTVdbRecords_2p0_03.mdb
  T:\LTVdbRecords\LTVdbRecords_2p0_04.mdb
Global file:
    T:\LTVdbGlobal_2p0.mdb

To to switch databases:

1. After login, close all viewing windows you may have open, return to Control Panel.
2. Select menu item 'LTV Utilities', then 'Set Database Path".  A window opens with fields you can set.  You only need to change the Default Database value. The next steps are right from the OneLambda installation document.

4.	Select the <Set to Default> button to set Current Database to the default database.
5.	Select <SAVE> to change links to selected database and paths.
A status bar will appear.  When complete, a message will appear to verify that paths/links have been set.
6.	Select <OK> - status bar will appear again.  A message will appear “Network path and global database has been reset – select <OK> and then <Close>.  Note that if a message box appears to indicate that paths are to be set, you will need to select <OK> to close the message box and the click <Close> to close the database setup menu.

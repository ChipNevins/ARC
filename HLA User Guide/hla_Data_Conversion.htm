<H4>Overview</H4>
Part of the project is to convert the existing Mumps data into Oracle.  I am converting the data starting with the most recent data, one month at a time.  To convert a particular month, I convert the data for all patients/donors that have a specimen accessioned during that month. The conversion program I use is just the XML writer and XML Reader run in batch mode. There is no separate conversion program except for a small driver.
<P>
<P ALIGN="left">The data I convert for each patient/donor is:</P>
<UL>
<LI>PERSON - ref#, name, DRN, Registration categ, Donor type, Donor location, donor center code, availability, comments</LI>
<LI>SPECIMEN - Number, specimen type, accession date, bleed date, who entered, hospital, comment (Note: inventory will be converted later)</LI>
<LI>HLA TYPE - The full HLA type and its history</LI>
<LI>TESTS - The test code, test type (e.g., HLA Test), order date, result date, result text, who entered, comment.</LI>
<LI>PERSON AUDIT - Converting the Mumps file which audits changes to the person</LI>
<LI>DICTIONARIES - The EMPLOYEE dictionary was converted in full.  Deleted entries are preserved as deleted. Other dictionaries have been populated as needed, e.g., when a specimen is converted that was collected at a particular hospital, that hospital is added to the dictionary</LI>

Reader having problems, shows file in SBT folder that are not really there.
Seems to happen mostly on Paul's machine.

XLS file from Dynal has value "Z0313_" in the R# column. My reader program does not give a good error message, and it does not update the 'last-reader-run' date, so the next time the reader is run, it pulls up the same files again.

- Directory "c:\hla\pbrun" is defined as AppDirectory in hla.ini [FileLocations]
- File c:\hla\pbrun\print_login_label.bat, with this one command line:
	LPR -S192.168.1.16 -PTECPRINTER LoginLabel.ZPL
On site, should replace this IP with the network IP the printer gets from DHCP
The batch file must be in the same directory as LoginLabel.zpl

In new label printing lines, changed hard-coded path reference to use:
 appDirectory = ProfileString(gnv_app.of_GetAppIniFile(), 'FileLocations', 'AppDirectory','c:\hla\')
 Change was added to these objects:

Email from Sharon on 10/4: The DP ambiguities are a little different than the other ambiguities in the system. DPB1*13:01 is ambiguous with DPB1*133:01 and DPB1*107:01 not DPB1*13:03:01,13:107:01. Most of our other ambiguities are within the same antigen assignment. Can you make that work?

Email finally working! Attached is the report: DP values did not BOLD on paper, but does bold on screen. Ambiguity value was cut; should be 10701/13301. Also want to decrease the margin on the left to center the entire report a little bit better. We want to search the data base for any patients that were reported as B*15:01, B*35:01. I also forgot to ask you about DOB. Is it possible to have the program accept 00/00/00?

I found another problem with the batch reports. Attached you will see two reports that have / mark, but no ambiguity result to follow. I circled them on the reports. I think these are antigens that previously had an ambiguity, but no longer does. When I edit this in the antigen list the only way to get rid of existing ambiguity is to add the antigen, but not list any ambiguities. I didn't realize that the / mark was printing on these reports. Can you add this to the fix list? Thank you so much. //

I found a new problem today. I updated a report for a patient typed in 2009 and it did not update all HLA alleles to 2010 nomenclature. It must be connected to the wide report changes, because this was working before. Report is attached. I circled the incorrect ones- all missing the colon. Thanks

9-17-12 email .25
I think these should be the final corrections.
1. Can you adjust the margins on either side of the page to center the report?
2. The name line at the top (RE: )needs to be able to add more letters. For the attached report I was unable to enter FINAL REPORT.
3. line up the DQB1 values
4. I added a DQA1 value to a different report and I am unable to BOLD the new value. I didn't check if this also happens with DPB1.
That's it.

I have another item that I hope you can check for me. Currently we are required to enter a specimen collection date when a sample is logged in. There are some samples where we do not have this info, but because it is a required field we enter T-1. I still want this to be a required field, but can you make it so the program will accept 00/00/00 as an accepted bleed date? This will allow us to log in the sample and the info will be correct. Thanks again for your all of your help.

Email from Sharon

The landscape report looks good. There are a couple of problems. I attached a report for you to see.
1. The DPB1 typing on file do not automatically populate the DPB1 field. I had to key these results into the field. I haven’t checked a DQA result yet.

2. There is an ambiguity for DPB1*04:01 with DPB1*126:01. The 12601 value also incorrectly populated the DQA,DQB and the DPB1*02:01 fields. I circled all the incorrect fields on the attached report.

3. The printed header is DPA1, should be DPB1. The computer screen shows DPB1, but it prints out as DPA1.

4. Is it possible to move the updated report and date over to the right side of the page?

5. Can you add the word usually to the ambiguous typing comment?

Second email
Can you make these additional changes as well?

1. Please extend the margins for comments. Now the comments will end about mid page, corresponds with the comment box on the screen- with wider page the comment field can be extended.

2.Can you also extend the footer comment at the bottom of the page to one line instead of two?

3. Is it possible to reduce the large space at the bottom of the report that has RE: and footer. This space takes up 1.5 inches of the page, so reports are printing with more pages.

- Email to Neng with HLA server plans and facts - 1.0hr

Gil and I worked Thursday night on-site, to inventory the servers and discuss options.  Here is what each server has on it today:

HLA1:  Oracle database and the R: 'Results' drive.  This server is almost 9 years old and needs to be replaced. 
HLA2:  Older OneLambda databases that you still need: Labtype Visual and HLA Visual. These products (we all remember) had complex setup steps, including application installs on the server, database links, etc. We think it would be risky to attempt to move these databases to another server.  They should stay on HLA2
HLA3:  Holds the S: drive files.  Not a production server suitable for a SQLServer or Oracle database
HLA4:  Holds HLA Fusion #1 database
HLA6:  Holds HLA Fusion #2 and #3 databases. Database #3 is our current database

Our priority is to protect the two day-to-day critical databases: Fusion #3 and Oracle.
- To protect Fusion #3, we can move Fusion #2 from HLA6 to HLA4.  This will leave enough room on HLA6 for one more year of growth.  Growth seems to be 200 gigabytes (GB) per year.
- To protect Oracle, we need to replace or upgrade the server from NT to Windows Server2003. To do this,we will need a new server. The servers HLA2,HLA3,HLA4,HLA6 are all fully allocated to the tasks described above, so thay cannot hold Oracle.

Gil has got some figures on a potential new server, with a price of $3,316. Please note that this amount is not a quote, but a figure to help you prepare the budget.

I will phone you in the next few days to follow up on this email, so that Gil and I can get started. If you want to reach me anytime before then, my cell phone is best: 617-515-6644.



3-16-12  2.0 hrs
- On-site with Gil, planning for future machines

HLA1 machine has Oracle and R: drive and P: drive
HLA2 has older OneLambda product databases: LabTypeVisual,HLAVisual and these versions had specific installation procedures that included application installs on the server, and which would complex and risky to move to another server.
HLA4 Has the HLA Fusion #1 database
HLA6 Has the HLA Fusion #2 and Fusion #3 database. Fusion #3 is our current database and is already 200GB in size. To accommodate 100GB/year projected growth, we will need to move Fusion #2 DB to HLA4.  Even with this, HLA6 can hold only about 1 more year of data.  If there is no DB purge from the vendor, we would need a new server just for Fusion #3 by the year after next.

Sharon,  This problem, which occurred for R# 428830, is fixed.  It was a dictionary change needed: the sero equivalent for C*08 is looked up under CW*08, so for antigen CW*08 I set the sero equivalent to CW8.  It was blank before.

---------------
The Final Single report calls the two NVOs below to create a final or patient report:
  n_final_report.of_SetAntigenDisplayValues()  added change for ambiguity string extra having length >10, add line to make it wrap in the display column.  Example is C*04:01
  n_patient_report.of_AdjustAntigenDisplay  added same change as above

Delete a patient report
Background: The table hla_report_hdr has a report for every version of a report for one person.  The Patient Report edit always opens the most recent version.  So, when a patient deletes a report for patient LAST,FIRST we will need to delete every version.

dba script:  alter_hla_report_hdr_add_delflag.sql
  alter table hla.hla_report_hdr
  add (
    delflag  number(1,0) default 0
    ) ;

dba script:  update_hla_report_hdr_set_delflag.sql
  update hla.hla_report_hdr
   set delflag = 0 ;
  commit ;

dw_lookup_report_name - add delflag=0 to WHERE clause
Test at home pkReportId=2542 (refnum=230639) is in list of matches for "SMI".  Delete

w_patient_report.cb_delete  button to delete all version of a report.

When user selects a patient report via the radio button in w_final_report_single, system looks up report by R#, so we needed to make this change also:
dw_lookup_report_refnum - new select staement is:
SELECT DISTINCT "HLA_REPORT_ITEM"."PKREPORTID"  
    FROM "HLA_REPORT_ITEM",   
         "HLA_REPORT_HDR"  
   WHERE ( "HLA_REPORT_ITEM"."PKREPORTID" = "HLA_REPORT_HDR"."PKREPORTID" ) and  
         ( ( "HLA_REPORT_ITEM"."STRREFNUM" = :as_refnum ) AND  
         ( "HLA_REPORT_ITEM"."NBRITEMSEQ" = 1 ) AND  
         ( "HLA_REPORT_HDR"."DELFLAG" = 0 ) )    

- tested with refnum = 230639, said No Patient Reports on file.

w_lookup_patient_report.dw_lookup  un-check property ib_rmbmenu so user does not get pop-up menu that shows insert/add/delete. The actions are not avilable from this dw
w_lookup_specimen.dw_lookup - unchecked ib_rmbmenu like above
u_nmdp_find.dw_find  - same change
w_lookup_person_for_login.dw_lookup - same change

Email from Sharon:
I hope you are enjoying the summer. There are two small problems in the Oracle program that need to be fixed when you get a chance. The first one is the ambiguity string on the individual reports is being cut off for some of the longer strings. An example is 324461-2 where C*04:01 string is cut off.
 
The second problem has been around for a long time. I just keep forgetting to let you know. For patient reports, we need the ability to delete the report. You can enter a report name and right click where there is a prompt to delete. When you do this the report isn’t actually deleted. Use the report for Landon, Celia. This report was created by mistake. She is a sibling of an existing patient, not a patient.

Email from Sharon still have a problem with one of the ambiguity strings cutting off values. Take a look at the report for patient Quinn, J.
In the ambiguity string for C*03:04 the last half of the 6 for 106 is cut off the report. Can you fix this?
Thank you so much. Have a great weekend.
C*03:04 ambig string is C*03:04/100/101/105/106  (this last '6' is getting truncated.

However not all of them changed. If you look up C*07:02 in the antigen dictionary, you can see what I mean. The ambiguity string below is without colons and the list on the same line as the antigen (saved value) still has the colons. HLA-B*07:02 has the same problem, but it doesn’t save the value in the line. Can you take a look and see if you can fix?

Also need to have the * on DRB3,4,5 corrected on patient reports. I have seen a couple of patient reports that add an extra spacing/row for ambiguities. It only happens on some reports and I’m not sure why. You can see an example if you look at patient report Belfi,Kathryn. The problem is visible on the print screen.

 - programming u_nmdp_export, tc. Sharon
Just checking to see how you are doing with the project 22 export for NMDP. I was hoping to talk with you about adding two functions to this export. Is it possible for the program to add XX to any low resolution value for export? An example of this would be DRB4*01 automatically convert to DRB4*01XX in export file. The message will be rejected if I send low resolution without XX. This will save me from keying it in for every donor.
 
The second request is it possible for the program to add the code for ambiguity samples? I know if I enter a code for an ambiguity the hard copy report can be decoded. Can it work the other way too? For example if I enter DRB1*1201 can the export program automatically code it DRB1*12DUKV? This would only apply to the antigens listed in the ambiguity strings table.
 
On another subject I had a problem sample this week that I was unable to edit. The sample ID is R381070. There were two previous entries for this patient -3 and -4 that were deleted. We logged in a new -4 on 3/16/11 and forgot to add to the specimen type as a bone marrow sample. When you attempt to edit this you only have access to edit the deleted sample. Is there a way to access the new -4 entry to edit?

 Agreed that I will fix the new add so it does not use deleted items.

03/08/11 Tues 3.0 hours

 - Version 3.07 build, sent to Sharon's PC and network
 - NMDP export TAB-DELIM format, added new nomenclature
 - Added security definition "AMBIGUITY STRINGS" to hla_security; changed ambiguity string window to look for this security code
 - Dated ambig strings: they were using result date, but CW test was not identified as giving a result date for C locus. Edited TEST CODE "Cw High resolution" in extra fields "RESULT FOR LOCI" changed "CW" to "CW,C"
 - Sharon phoned to say HML export not translating to new nomenclature.  I had tested this at home, and it worked on my pc for NMDP batch #5521.
 - Patient report: added '*' to DRB1/DRB3/DQB1; R12345 w/o space, cbx_ambig and cbx_name2010 checked by default.
 - Final report: made cbx_ambig and cbx_name2010 checked by default


03/07/11 Mon 1.5 hours

 - Project 22 spec: New format named 'Project 22', user will select a hospital, system will print donors in open batch that have specimens logged in with that hospital
 - Patient report formatting: 'R' is separated from number that wraps, make it "R123456" w/o spaces. Add '*' to DRB1, DB1 headers
 - Add security level to the new Ambig String window
 - TAB-delim export - make it convert values to new nomenclature
 - Make ambig-string and new-nomenclature checked 'y' by default on final single, final batch, patient report
 - Printing NMDP export grid, it goes to two pages so that Sharon has to look at two pages to see a single row
- After we spoke today I found another problem. I made several changes to ambiguity strings on Friday with effective date change of 3/2/11. I entered the changes thru the antigen dictionary, but they are not printing on the patient reports.
Two examples C*12:03 has new ambiguity C*12:23 (also entered C*1203/1223). This should print for sample 412415 and 411234-2 entered today. The patient report is Perez,J.
Also added a new ambiguity for C*0501. Previous string was C*0501/0503; new string is C*0501/0503/0537 (also entered as C*05:01/05:03/05:37). This should print for R412310 on patient report Boone,P.
They look correct on both the ambiguity string table and the amb dictionary, but don’t appear on reports. Can you check? I will hold up sending these reports. Thanks

 TC Sharon:  Report problems came from defintition - all set.
  Created a build on Friday night


02/24/11 Thu .5hrs
Hi Chip,
I was able to test the new build to the test system. There are still problems in results entry and in the reports.
 
1. Result entry- still have the same problems entering C typing results; won’t accept values 0202, 0802 etc, but will accept 02:02 and 08:02. Gives the same message.

2. Single reports- still a problem, if you select 2010 nomenclature only – the report is correct. If you select 2010nom and ambiguity the report is incorrect for A,B and DRB3/4/5, but correct for C,DR and DQ.

3. Patient reports- same problem as seen with single report described above. Also landscape doesn’t work with letterhead and has an extra box around results. Do we really need landscape?

4. Tested the antigen list and new ambiguity strings. This worked well. I added a new ambiguity B:35:01/35:42. Unfortunately I can’t get it display on any report. I am not sure if this is related to problems listed above.

5. New C values are missing sero equivalents. Will I have to add them all to the live system?

6. I couldn’t locate the antigen list on the C drive. Can you help me again with this? Thanks
Do you have time on Friday to talk? I am available from noon on. Look forward to hearing from you.


02/22/11 Tues - On-site 4.5 hrs
  - tc Sharon: Check import of expected typings
  - w_antigen_translation - it now adds ambiguity string rows for the v3 allele to match the v2 allele
  - w_ambiguity_strings - to update the ambiguity strings of v3 alleles
  - m_frame_hla - in Data Entry > Admin > added menu item for ambig strings
  - checked that NMDP export sends v3 values
  - new nomenclature

 - Description of the antigens changes - sent what's below to Sharon for her to review

=====================================================

Later this week, the HLA Oracle application will be implementing support for WHO HLA Nomenclature Version 3.0. To do this, we will be adding ver3 nomenclature values to two places in our master Antigens table:


1) For existing antigens, such as B*0702, we will add the ver3 value, B*07:02 as the value of the new field "Name2010":

  Antigen name   Sero equiv   Current Ambig string	Name 2010
  B*0702         B7           B*0702/0716               B*07:02

This change will aid reporting: if the user clicks the "2010 Nomenclature" checkbox in Final or Patient Reports, a person typed as B*0702 will be reported as B*07:02

2) For each new ver3 value we use above, we will also create a new antigen row

  Antigen name   Sero equiv   Current Ambig string	Name 2010
  B*07:02         B7                                    B*07:02

This change will allow the antigen B*07:02 to be used in Result Entry. Note that this entry does NOT have an ambiguity string - the HLA staff must define these.

3) Many of the mappings are being done based on the hla_nomenclature_file.txt provided to me by ARC.
The remainder of the mappings, for example NMDP codes, are done with an algorithm that follows NMDP document 12269 and dated JUL 2010.

  Antigen name   Sero equiv   Current Ambig string	Name 2010
  B*07AEBM       B7                                     B*07:AEBN

Some antigens are not mapped: those with 2 or 5 characters after the "*", or multiple values: For example, these antigens are not mapped:
  A*01011, A*02, A*02014, DRB1*15/16

4) How reports will work

- The antigen reported
    If person typed as B*0702, the report will show B*0701, or if the "2010 Nomenclature" box is checked, B*07:02
    If person typed as B*07:02, the value B*07:02 will ALWAYS be reported

- The ambiguity string reported:
    If person typed as B*0702, report will show ambig string for B*0702, but if "2010 Nomenclature" box is checked it will show the ambig string assigned for B*07:02. So it's IMPORTANT to define all ambiguity strings for these antigens
    If person typed as B*07:02, report will always show the ambig string for B*07:02

=========================================================


02/20/11 Sun - arc 5.0 hrs  w_antigen translation, 3 buttons

 - Clear: remove all rows from hla_antigen and hla_antigen_ambiguity that have an antigen primary
   key containing a colon, e.g. A*01:01. Set NULL for strName2010 column of all antigens

 - Run mapping: read hla_nomenclature_file.txt.  Each row of this file has an old nomenclature allele in column 1, and the map-to new nomenclature value in column 2. Populate the strName2010 field, and create a new antigen for the new value

  Example: the row:   A*0101     A*01:01
  For antigen A*0101, set strName2010 = A*01:01
  Create new row for antigen A*01:01, and its strName2010 value is also A*01:01

 - Map un-mapped values, such as NMDP codes: DRB5*0108N has strName2010 = DRB5*01:08N

Some values do not get mapped:
  A*02 - only two digits
  A*01011 - five digits
  DRB5*01011,0105,0109

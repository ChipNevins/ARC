Genotyping assigned: Yes

When ambiguous typing combination exists, the most frequent allele is usually listed first.

 And replace with these as selectable choices:
 
·         Low/Intermediate resolution HLA typing was performed by PCR-SSOP.

·         Allelic resolution HLA typing was performed by Next Generation Sequencing (NGS), Sanger sequencing, PCR-SSOP.

·         HLA antibody screen was performed by Luminex Mixed Screen assay.

·         HLA antibody analysis was performed by Luminex Single Antigen Bead (SAB) assay.

·         Platelet antibody screen/crossmatch was performed by Solid Phase Red Cell Adherence (SPRCA) assay.

·         HLA-DPB1 T Cell Epitope (TCE) matching was referenced from Blood 2009; 114:1437-44, Lancet Oncol. 2012 Apr; 13(4):366-74.
